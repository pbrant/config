A few notes on my (primitive) ccap3 Scala editing setup
---------------------------------------------

Tools
  - tmux. vim inspired config file is ~/.tmux.conf (mostly courtesy of cwinebr,
    with a few minor edits)
  - ctags. Scala language definition is in ~/.ctags. It works pretty well, but
    does not match case class fields (no val).
  - vim. Config file is ~/.vimrc along with ~/.vimsauce and ~/.vim (certainly
    no longer up-to-date, would be [much!] better to use Pathogen)

Basic Scala (ccap3) workflow:
  - cd ~/v4workspace/ccap3
  - tmux
  - one large editor pane, one or two tool panes stacked to the left (for sbt
    or runwebpack)
  - File navigation via Ctrl+P (CtrlP plugin); buffer navigation with \b (also
    CtrlP via .vimrc)
  - :Sauce ccap3 to load ccap3 specific config (,cd change to directory of
    current file; ,gh go back to ~/v4workspace/ccap3; ,cc regenerate tags; add
    ccap3 ctags file)
  - :ts, :tj, Ctrl+] for tag navigation
  - Ctrl+kk to grep based word under cursor

~/v4workspace/ccap3/sourcedeps/tags is created via grabthem.sh + unpackthem.sh
+ ctags. The first just greps through the gen-idea generated config files
looking for source JARs.

I have not tried http://ensime.org/editors/vim/ or ENSIME with Emacs +
evil.

I do rarely (maybe once every few months) still use IntelliJ (+ the ideavim
plugin) for browsing an unfamiliar code base.
